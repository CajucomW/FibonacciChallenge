# Fibonacci Challenge

A simple, python-powered app that will calculate the nth Fibonacci number. I'll be trying to recreate an activity I learned from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstartcoding.com">KickStart Coding</a>. 

- clone the repo
- in terminal run
    <code>python3 fibonacci.py</code>
    
TODO:
<ol>
    <li>Write a function that will calculate the nth Fibonacci number (where n is
# a parameter), and return that value</li>

    <li>Come up ith a "test plan" for this function</li>
    
    <li>Use "assert" to test your code. Assert is for sanity checks in code<li/>
</ol>
