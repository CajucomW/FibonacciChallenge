print('Fibonacci Challenge')

# The Fibonacci Sequence are the numbers where every number after the first two
# is the sum of the two preceding ones. For example:
# 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, etc.
# 1. Write a function that will calculate the nth Fibonacci number (where n is
# a parameter), and return that value.
# 2. Come up ith a "test plan" for this function.
# 3. Use "assert" to test your code. Assert is for sanity checks in code.

# HINT: 
## There are a few ways to do approach this.
# The formula for approximation is explained here:

## I just looked up the code to all of this from various different sources
## I don't think I even understand what the heck is going on at all!
